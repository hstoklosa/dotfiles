# hstoklosa.files

This repository is a collection of the configuration files for my Windows and macOS setups. These are the tweaks, shortcuts, and customisations I use to make my dev environment feel great, no matter which machine I'm on. I got tired of setting everything up from scratch every time I switched machines or reinstalled an OS and by keeping my dotfiles versioned and synced, I can get a consistent setup up and running in no time.

## tools

- [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) - GitHubâ€™s official command line tool
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) - A feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A command-line fuzzy finder
- [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) - Render markdown on the CLI, with pizzazz!

## thanks

I want to say thanks to all the people that have open-sourced their configuration (dot)files and scripts, as they've been invaluable when it comes to customising and improving my own workflow. I hope this repository can offer the same value to others looking to enhance their setup.

If you're interested in exploring or starting your own dotfiles, check out [the unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
