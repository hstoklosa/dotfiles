# hstoklosa.files

This repository is a collection of the configuration files for my Windows and macOS setups. It consists of tweaks, shortcuts, and customisations I use to make my dev environment feel great, no matter which machine I'm on.

I got tired of setting everything up from scratch every time I switched machines or reinstalled an OS and by keeping my dotfiles versioned and synced, I can get a consistent setup up and running in no time.
