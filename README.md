# hstoklosa.files

This repository is a collection of the configuration files for my Windows and macOS setups. It consists of tweaks, shortcuts, and customisations I use to make my dev environment feel great, no matter which machine I'm on.

I got tired of setting everything up from scratch every time I switched machines or reinstalled an OS and by keeping my dotfiles versioned and synced, I can get a consistent setup up and running in no time.

I want to say thanks to all the people that have open-sourced their configuration (dot)files and scripts, as they've been invaluable when it comes to customising and improving my own workflow. I hope this repository can offer the same value to others looking to enhance their setup.
